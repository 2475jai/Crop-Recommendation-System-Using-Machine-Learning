🌿 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-powered web application that empowers farmers and agriculturists by recommending the most suitable crop to grow based on various environmental and soil parameters. By leveraging data-driven insights, it aims to maximize agricultural yield and promote sustainable farming practices.

📈 Features
🔍 Smart Crop Prediction
Recommends optimal crops based on:

Soil Nutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)

Weather Parameters: Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall

Soil Acidity: pH value

🖥️ User-Friendly Interface

Clean and responsive Flask web app

Intuitive form-based input

Displays crop insights and descriptions after prediction

🧠 Powered by Machine Learning

Trained Random Forest Classifier model (scikit-learn)

Based on publicly available agricultural datasets
